# CardioHealth
The proposed project idea is concerned with the utilization of Serious Games in terms of home-based patient rehabilitation. The main goal here is to attempt to provide motivation during the exercises as well as monitor their condition and heart rate while using the Microsoft Kinect 2 integrated into a customized open source game engine. 
The problem to be solved is to monitor that patients follow their exercise programmes regularly. Doctors/Physiotherapists may also be updated with their progress without consistent visits.
